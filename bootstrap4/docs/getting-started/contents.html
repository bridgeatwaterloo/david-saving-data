<p>Bootstrap can come in one of two forms, as precompiled or source code. Learn more about each flavor&#39;s contents and structure below. Remember, no matter the implementation flavor, <strong>Bootstrap&#39;s JavaScript plugins require jQuery</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="precompiled-bootstrap">Precompiled Bootstrap</h2>
<p>Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder and you&#39;ll see something like this:</p>
<!-- NOTE: This info is intentionally duplicated in the README. Copy any changes made here over to the README too. -->
<p>{% highlight bash %}
bootstrap/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   └── bootstrap.min.css.map
└── js/
    ├── bootstrap.js
    └── bootstrap.min.js
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This is the most basic form of Bootstrap: precompiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap.*</code>), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap.min.*</code>). CSS <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors">source maps</a> (<code>bootstrap.*.map</code>) are available for use with certain browsers&#39; developer tools.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap-source-code">Bootstrap source code</h2>
<p>The Bootstrap source code download includes the precompiled CSS and JavaScript assets, along with source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
bootstrap/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
├── docs/
│   └── examples/
├── js/
└── scss/
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The <code>scss/</code> and <code>js/</code> are the source code for our CSS and JavaScript. The <code>dist/</code> folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The <code>docs/</code> folder includes the source code for our documentation, and <code>examples/</code> of Bootstrap usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>
